"""
- OBS has built in settings to display images, scroll them, etc.. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npSLOVsZ9yQ

- streamelements is kind of an "all in one" for overlays https://streamelements.com/features/overlays 
- works in conjunction with OBS

- streamlabs https://streamlabs.com/
- kind of like streamelements + OBS together
- streamelements might be better because this doesn't have bilibili?
